# Cycling Superstores Business Data Analysis

Bike retail company lacks a centralized platform to gain insights into its sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends. Let's explore this problem in the perspective of a business data analyst.

This way we can gain insights into the company's sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends. The company lacked a centralized platform to analyze and visualize its data, making it challenging to identify areas for improvement and growth opportunities.

## Project Overview

**Project Title:** Building an Interactive Sales Dashboard for Data-driven Decision-Making at Cycling Superstores

**Problem Statement:** Cycling Superstores lacked a centralized and user-friendly platform to analyze sales data. This made it difficult for executives to gain insights into sales performance across various metrics like product category, brand, store location, and customer demographics.

## Data Sources:

**Relational Database:** The project utilized data from Cycling Superstores' internal relational database containing sales transactions, customer information, product details, and store locations.

The primary data source for this analysis was the company's transactional data, which included information about sales orders, products, customers, and store locations. Additionally, we utilized publicly available data sources to enrich the analysis with demographic and market trend information.

## Methodology

The project involved the following steps:

* **Data Acquisition:** SQL queries were written to extract relevant data from the relational database, including order details, customer information, product categories, brands, store locations, and sales rep IDs.
* **Data Cleaning:** The extracted data was reviewed and cleaned in Excel to address any missing values, inconsistencies, or redundancies.
* **Data Analysis:** Pivot tables and charts were used in Excel to analyze sales trends by year, month, state, store, brand, product category, customer, and sales rep.
* **Data Visualization:**
  * Excel: Charts like line charts, pie charts, and bar charts were created to present key sales insights in Excel.
  * Tableau: Interactive visualizations like line charts, map charts, pie charts, tree maps, and bar charts were developed in Tableau for a more dynamic and informative dashboard.
* **Dashboard Creation:**
  * Excel: A basic sales dashboard was built in Excel, combining various charts with slicers to allow for interactive filtering by year, state, and store name.
  * Tableau: An interactive dashboard was created in Tableau, enabling executives to explore sales data by year, state, store, brand, product category, customer, and sales rep. Action filters were implemented to ensure all charts update dynamically based on user selections.

## Data Preparation and Exploration

Before diving into the analysis, we performed data cleaning and preprocessing tasks to ensure the data was consistent and ready for analysis. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data into a suitable format.

During the exploratory data analysis phase, we examined the data from various angles, including:

* Sales trends over time
* Top-selling products and categories
* Customer segmentation and behavior patterns
* Regional performance and market potential

### Data Visualization and Reporting

To effectively communicate the findings and insights, we created interactive dashboards and reports using Excel and Tableau. These visualizations allowed stakeholders to explore the data dynamically and gain a comprehensive understanding of the business performance.
